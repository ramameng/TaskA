First of all, this code purposed is to delete any text files in directory from input and then checking which text files is below than date that user input too.
But in this code, what i improved is on the looping instead using "for" i choose to use "foreach" becasuse is more clean that use "for".
And then i improve the information back to user if files already deleted or there is no files that match the criteria that user input.
